# Avrio Bot ++
A C# recode/reworking of Madk's TrtlBot++
    Modified to use with Avrio

	--added Command .dynamit as alias to complete networkstats block
	--added Command .reward to check blocktimes and for miners to calc a reward based on hashrate
	 ( .reward function born based on Teamwork with active Community during discord chat in Nov. 2018)
	
	maybe more to come ...
